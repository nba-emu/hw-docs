# Foreword

This documentation was created out of the need to document new Game Boy Advance hardware research findings.

It does not currently aim to replace existing documentation, as that would be a massive undertaking.
Instead it aims to complement existing documentation and to correct it where it is inaccurate.

The target audience for this documentation should mostly be emulator developers and individuals who
are curious to learn how the Game Boy Advance really operates.
Homebrew programmers might be inclined towards a more comprehensive documentation in most cases for now.
